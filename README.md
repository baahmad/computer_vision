# computer_vision

This repository contains exercises I did to explore different computer vision topic. Each topic directory contains a writeup of what was done as well as the code and input files if you want to run the exercises yourself. Note that if you want to run the code, you will need to update the pathing to the input files in the code to wherever you saved the input files.
