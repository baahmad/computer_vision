I am working on an application takes a livestream of you playing the piano and displays in real time the notes you are playing. 
The motivation behind the app is that I take piano lessons but the onset of the coronavirus has forced those lessons to be held
over Zoom. Sometimes the audio quality across video communication apps is degraded so it can be difficult to discern for an
instructor what notes are being played. Transcribing the notes in real time and displaying them on the app allows the instructor
to confirm which notes are being played. I tested the algorithm for these apps and did a write up for it as a graduate student. The
paper describing this algorithms is in this directory.
